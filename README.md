Ever feel the need to backup an important note before modifying it or just to keep a history of changes made to it, this plugin will come in handy in such situations.

## Usage

Simply right click on a note and you get two options:

1. "Make a copy" which will create a copy of the selected note right next to it
2. "Take a snapshot" which will create a copy the note to a user-defined folder

## Config

"Snapshot folder": Provide a folder name where snapshots of notes should be stored.

That's it, enjoy!
