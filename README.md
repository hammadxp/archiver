Ever feel the need to backup an important note before modifying it or just to keep a history of changes made to it, this plugin will come in handy in such situations.

BackItUp is a simple Obsidian plugin to quickly backup any note. Simply right click a note and you get two options:

1. "Make a copy" which will create a copy of the selected note right next to it.
2. "Take a snapshot" which will create a copy the note to a user-defined folder.

## Install

Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).

-   Clone this repo to `.obsidian/plugins` folder in your Obsidian vault.
-   Run `npm i` or `yarn` to install plugin dependencies.
-   Now enable this plugin in `Obsidian -> Settings -> Community plugins`

That's it, enjoy!
