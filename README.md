Archiver is a simple plugin for Obsidian to quickly archive or duplicate a note. Ever feel the need to backup an important note before modifying it or just to keep a history of changes to a note, I felt that too, that's why I created this plugin :)

Simply right click a note and select "Archive note" to move it directly to the configured archive folder.

## Install

Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).

-   Clone this repo to `.obsidian` in your Obsidian vault.
-   `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
-   Enable plugin in `Obsidian -> Settings -> Community plugins`

That's it, enjoy!
